The following repository contains simple image-filtering code designed for images with a .bmp file extension.
Usage: ./filter [flag] infile outfile 
Available filters: 
  -y: force symmetry (beta) 
  -g: grayscale 
  -r: reflect 
  -s: sepia 
  -i: invert 
  -b [surround]: blur 
  -e [threshold]: edge detection

This project was inspired by Harvard CS50. I used the templates provided by them in the challenge "filter" in problem set 4. Additional features were added by me.

Running ./makefile will compile the program with gcc, but you are welcome to compile it yourself if you want.

This is my first repository. Thanks for taking a look!
